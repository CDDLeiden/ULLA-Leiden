You will find an `init.sh` script in each folder with Jupyter Notebooks. This script will install all the required packages and is executed in the beginning of each notebook. Note that after reinitialization of the Notable environment, the script needs to be executed again. However, all the files you create will be persisted across sessions. In order, to download this repository, you can use the following shell command:

```bash

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDDLeiden/ULLA2023-Leiden/master/init.sh?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABRXDNY4YIB2B2XREGD3IPWYZAI72VQ -O init.sh && chmod +x init.sh && ./init.sh
```

You can also execute it from a Jupyter Notebook cell (note the `!` in front of the command):

```bash
!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CDDLeiden/ULLA2023-Leiden/master/init.sh?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABRXDNY4YIB2B2XREGD3IPWYZAI72VQ -O init.sh && chmod +x init.sh && ./init.sh
```
